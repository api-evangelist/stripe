      Tokenization is the process Stripe uses to collect sensitive card or bank
      account details, or personally identifiable information (PII), directly
      from your customers in a secure manner. A token representing this
      information is returned to your server to use. Use our recommended
      payments integrations to perform this process on the client-side. This
      guarantees that no sensitive card data touches your server, and allows
      your integration to operate in a PCI-compliant way.
